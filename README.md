Some furry in the tech space, how original. I'm a janitor @ e621 and sometimes contribute to the site when I have an idea, or want to implement an idea.

If you want to contact me for some reason, you can email me @ `github(at)yiff.today` but I will likely block you if your email is pointless. If you really want to send me memes or anything else, please just do it to `memes(at)yiff.today`, in which case I might reply with a meme of my own, but my blocks are domain wide, and I don't give second chances when it comes to wasting my time.

I specialize in backend with Node.JS and C#, with plenty of experience in unity and godot, mainly with modding. Though I have experience in practically any non-defunct languages other than the other major C languages. I consider myself technically capable enough to pick up any major language if necessary, since I already have all the logic down, it's just syntax primarily.

I know my way around HTML and CSS as well for front end purposes, but I'm not a designer.

I do need a job, and I'll do literally anything that doesn't involve AI. Obviously furry-related would be a plus, but anything works, I just need money. In that case, you can reach me @ `hireme(at)yiff.today`.
